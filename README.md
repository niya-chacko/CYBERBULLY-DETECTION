# CYBERBULLY-DETECTION
cyber bully detection in malaylam langauage
As the number of people using social media
continues to rise, cyberbullying, also known as online bullying, is
a type of bullying that occurs through electronic messages.
Bullies might utilize social media as a means of launching
assaults against their victims. Given the negative effects of
cyberbullying on victims, it&#39;s critical to look for acceptable ways
to intervene and stop it. Machine learning may be used to look at
bullies&#39; language patterns and develop a model to look at
cyberbullying behavior. To address these issues, the use of
machine learning methods is proposed, as well as the inclusion of
essential information for cyberbullying identification on
Malayalam text. The analysis of the projected approach on
cyberbullying information set shows that RNN is employed to
urge higher and achieves high accuracy. . The accuracy of the
created models was tested using a 10-fold cross-validation
methodology. Overall, there were two phases to the process: the
first included solely text-based features (posts/comments), and
the second included both text-based features and user
information. The extracted data from the Facebook scraper is
utilized to detect whether the post or remark is bullying or not,
and the performance of social media bullying detection on
Malayalam and English material is eventually determined. The
suggested model&#39;s cross-validation findings show that an RNN is
the classifier that produces higher performance on Malayalam
text, with a detection accuracy of 99 % besides.
